 <link>http://www.watchmn.org/online-newsletters/summer-2011/earning-peoples-trust-every-day</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Marna Anderson, Executive Director&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, I lived in rural El Salvador and worked with a nongovernmental organization. The civil war had ended. Law enforcement was no longer controlled by the military, but local police departments were nonexistent in many parts of the country.

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DANIEL JAMES HART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hart, 32, was charged with felony domestic assault and domestic assault by strangulation (felony) for assaulting his girlfriend.
