    <p>This column includes a sampling of the cases WATCH volunteers have monitored in recent months.</p> <p><strong>ERIC KEPRICE RICHARD</strong></p> <p>In the Autumn 2010 issue of this newsletter, WATCH published a chronology of the domestic violence committed by serial offender Eric Keprice Richard. The chronology concluded with Judge Richard Scherer ordering him to serve 210 days in the workhouse with credit for 39 days, a consequence of his third probation violation in 14 months. The underlying case—his twenty-fourth in the chronology—was an assault in which he punched the victim in the face when she tried to stop him from leaving with their five-year-old son.</p>  <p>In September 2011, Richard violated his probation for this case a fourth time, failing to maintain contact with his probation officer and providing a positive urinalysis. One month later, he admitted to violating his probation, and Judge Allen Oleisky executed his 21-month sentence with credit for 340 days served.</p> <p><strong> CHAD ALLEN HENDRICKSON </strong></p> <p>Chad Allen Hendrickson, 21, was charged with felony domestic assault by strangulation and felony third degree assault for an assault on his ex-girlfriend. According to the criminal complaint, Hendrickson forced the victim to the ground and strangled her with both hands. When the victim freed herself, Hendrickson threw her into a wall, causing her head to hit a corner. Hendrickson’s mother heard the assault, intervened, and drove the victim to the hospital. The victim suffered a severe laceration to her head that required ten staples. The defendant later admitted to police that he attempted to strangle the victim with the intention of restricting her breathing and that after throwing her into a wall, observed blood coming from the victim’s forehead.</p> <p>Prosecutor Joshua Larson dismissed the case before Judge Toddrick Barnette; the defense attorney was Jeanette Boerner.</p> <p><strong>CHONG TEE XIONG </strong></p> <p>Chong Tee Xiong, 19, was charged with felony first degree criminal sexual conduct for sexually assaulting his eight-yearold stepsister. The victim’s mother reported the incident, and the victim described what happened during a subsequent forensic interview. When Xiong was interviewed by police regarding the assault, he admitted touching the victim under her clothing.</p> <p>Xiong pleaded guilty as charged, and Judge Robert Small sentenced him to 144 months in prison stayed for 10 years, a departure from the sentencing guidelines, stating that Xiong demonstrated remorse. His probation conditions include: serve 365 days in the workhouse with credit for 97 days and furloughs for sex offender treatment, complete sex offender treatment, supply DNA sample, no contact with the victim, register as a predatory offender, no contact with minor females until approved by court, obtain GED, and maintain employment. Thad Tudor was the prosecutor, and Fue Thao was the defense attorney.</p> <p><strong>JOHN HENRY EDMONDS, JR. </strong></p> <p>John Henry Edmonds, Jr., 29, was charged with felony first degree burglary and felony domestic assault for breaking into the home of the mother of his child (Case 1), repeatedly punching the victim in the face, pulling out a portion of her hair, and threatening to kill her if she called the police. He was arrested and jailed for that assault. Three months later, Edmonds was charged with 16 counts of felony violation of a domestic abuse no contact order for repeatedly calling the victim from jail (Case 2). According to the criminal complaint, he had made more than 225 calls to the victim against court orders. In several of the calls, Edmonds identifies himself, admits to the assault, and encourages her not to testify.</p> <p>Edmonds pleaded guilty to felony first degree burglary in Case 1, and one count of felony violation of a domestic abuse no contact order in Case 2. The remaining charges were dismissed. Judge Peter Cahill sentenced him to 66 months with credit for 137 days in Case 1 and 30 months with credit for 133 days in Case 2. The sentences are to be served concurrently. Stuart Shapiro was the prosecutor, and Gay Glaze was the defense attorney.</p> <p><strong>ARNOLD DARWIN WAUKAZO </strong></p> <p>Arnold Darwin Waukazo, 41, was charged with first degree premeditated murder for killing a transgendered woman he had been dating. According to Waukazo’s statement to the police, he strangled the victim to unconsciousness and then stabbed her multiple times. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be complex homicidal violence.</p> <p>Waukazo was found guilty of second degree murder at trial. Judge Oleisky sentenced him to 367 months in prison with credit for 343 days, denying his request for a lesser sentence with the observation that he had shown no remorse. Darren Borg was the prosecutor, and Julius Nolen was the defense attorney.</p>  </div>
