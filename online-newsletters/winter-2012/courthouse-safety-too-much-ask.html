    <p><strong>by Marna Anderson</strong></p><p>There are not many areas of agreement amongst advocates, judges, law enforcement, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and court personnel, so when all agree that courtroom security is a problem, those holding the purse strings should take note. Following the December courtroom shooting in Grand Marais, Judge Lloyd Zimmerman’s refusal to continue hearing cases at Brookdale provided the opportunity to share with the public the ongoing safety concerns at Hennepin County’s three suburban courthouses.</p> <p>WATCH conducted a two-year study of Hennepin County’s suburban courts and released the report, <em>Promoting Victim Safety and Offender Accountability: Improving the Response to Misdemeanor Domestic Violence Cases</em>, in April 2011. One recommendation was to install weapons screening, and since that time, we have made it one of our organization’s primary goals to advocate for greater courtroom security. Unfortunately, our call for improvements has received little notice because, as we all know, security just isn’t a big deal until tragedy strikes. Sadly, that’s what it has taken once again for Hennepin County to take note.</p> <p>As citizen courtroom monitors, WATCH volunteers provide a unique perspective on our courtrooms – they are often the only ones in the courtroom without an interest in a specific outcome. In part, they observe and document the courtroom environment, including the demeanor of courtroom personnel, defendants, and those present in the gallery, which routinely include victims, family members, and children. The lack of weapons screening or other safety measures was a concern highlighted in monitoring forms throughout the course of the suburban courts study.</p> <p>A few of our monitors’ comments included:</p> <p><em>There should be a metal detector to screen everyone who enters the courtrooms. Some of the defendants were obviously angry and could pose a threat, despite the presence of deputies – that is, when the deputies were in the courtroom. In sum, security was lacking, except for in-custody cases.</em></p> <p><em>A defendant approached the clerk and was quite insistent that she do something for him, which she refused to do. She told him his attorney would have to take care of it. He became very incensed, and she remained very assertive. I was concerned for her safety, and the deputy who had been sitting next to her was gone.</em></p> <p>In response to Judge Zimmerman’s demand for increased security, Hennepin County court administration responded by indicating that each courtroom is staffed with armed deputies. However, WATCH monitors noted in our study that deputies were only in the courtrooms sporadically, and several minutes may go by without one present. Advocates have told WATCH that both they and prosecutors at times feel unsafe and that deputies “are never close enough to stop anything” from happening in the courtroom or waiting areas.</p><p>Monitors also commented:</p> <p><em>The deputies popped their heads in and out of the courtroom and were not present when the judge was on the bench.</em></p> <p><em>The clerk spent nearly 15 minutes looking for a deputy so she could call the in-custody cases.</em></p> <p>WATCH staff asked state court administration for the number of Minnesota courtrooms without weapons screening, but were told this information is not readily available. Courtroom security is a back burner issue until a fire is ignited, all too frequently because of the sort of violence that occurred in December in Grand Marais.</p> <p>As District Court considers the short- and long-term security needs, another safety concern identified in our report should be addressed: the need for separate waiting areas for victims. With the large number of people in and out of the courtrooms, and deputies who are inconsistently present, little comfort is provided to victims who must wait in the same gallery as the defendant. Monitors documented victims and defendants seated together in the courtroom, leaving the courtroom together, and at times observed advocates taking victims into private offices to avoid defendants. These scenarios demonstrate violations of the victim’s right to a separate waiting area or other safeguards.<sup>1</sup> As one volunteer noted, “[t]he process in general is insensitive for victims choosing to attend court. They should either have a specific waiting area for victims or schedule hearings at accurate times to decrease the time victims have to be exposed to defendants.”</p> <p>It should come as no surprise that violations of no contact orders are more likely to occur in situations where victims and defendants are waiting in the same area for long periods of time. When documenting violations, monitors commented that often the judge or an attorney acknowledged the violation and reminded the parties that an order was in place, but in only one instance did a monitor observe a defendant being arrested for the violation. Violations in the courtroom occur in the presence of deputies, attorneys, and judges, and should be treated the same as if they were occurring elsewhere – as a crime.</p> <p>Now is the time for Hennepin County District Court to take action on security concerns in the suburban courthouses considering both the long-term and short-term needs. Ensuring that weapons are not carried into the courthouses is the minimum level of security that everyone deserves in the short-term, and equally important for the long-term is to guarantee that victims are free from threats, intimidation, and acts of violence. If these measures are something we can all agree on, then let’s get them done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><sup>1</sup> Minn. Stat. § 611A.034.</p>  </div>
