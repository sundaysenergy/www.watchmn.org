    <p>by Amy Arcand, Executive Director</p> <hr /><p>Proper handling of domestic violence cases is homicide prevention.<br /> Michigan District Court Judge Elizabeth Pollard Hines</p> <hr /><p>Scott Allen Youngmark, 41, was charged in December with first degree intentional homicide for the murder of Kari Roberts in Polk County, Wisconsin. On December 1, Roberts was found dead in the apartment she shared with Youngmark. A medical examiner listed homicidal violence as the preliminary cause of death. Local news sources reported that Youngmark told his mother, “I think I killed her,” shortly before an anonymous 911 call was placed from his mother’s home.</p> <p>This case was brought to our attention by an advocate from a Wisconsin domestic violence service agency who had read WATCH’s 2009 chronology of Youngmark’s violent criminal record in Minnesota.<sup>1</sup> WATCH chronologies document the criminal histories of defendants with long records of sexual and domestic violence who, for the most part, have gone unchecked by the criminal justice system. WATCH is able to identify troubling cases and trends because our volunteers spend over 4,000 hours each year in Hennepin County courts observing cases involving violence against women and children. In Youngmark’s case, we documented 39 criminal cases over 23 years – 20 of which resulted in a total of 69 charges. His violence extended to 18 victims, including acquaintances, family members, and intimate partners.</p> <p>Since the publication of the WATCH report, Youngmark moved to Wisconsin where he continued to assault and threaten people. Court records show that Youngmark was charged in 2011 with battery, disorderly conduct, injury by negligent use of a weapon, and 2nd degree reckless endangering of safety. In 2012 he was charged with three counts of felony intimidation of a witness. All charges were dismissed except the charge of 2nd degree reckless endangering of safety. On December 1, the day Roberts’ body was found, and four days before he was scheduled to reappear in court, Youngmark was out of jail pending felony charges for bail jumping.</p> <p>When this murder was committed, I had been executive director of WATCH for only a month. When I heard that Youngmark was the suspect, I wondered, “Do WATCH’s offender chronologies profile potential killers?” And, I couldn’t help but observe that, with a history of violence as significant as Youngmark’s, should anyone who is aware of his history be surprised that he is the suspect in a domestic homicide?</p> <p>In truth, there is never any one thing that can predict or prevent homicide. But if WATCH chronologies can be indicative of potential killers, what else can they tell us that can be of use? Youngmark’s chronology highlights at least three areas where the justice system can improve its response to domestic violence.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. For defendants with histories of sexual and domestic violence, complete information about past cases should be readily available to judges and prosecutors, both within and across jurisdictions.</strong></p> <p>Such histories should include cases that do not lead to criminal charges and the reasons that charges were not pursued. Cases of sexual and domestic violence are rarely isolated incidents, making it imperative that the bench fully understands and is better able to assess the level of violence and danger in each case.</p> <p>WATCH’s chronology documented cases in Hennepin, Anoka, Ramsey, and Todd counties. After the murder, WATCH’s chronology was widely circulated among law enforcement and local media in Wisconsin, but we don’t know what, if any, information the Wisconsin courts had on Youngmark’s history in Minnesota before it occurred.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Especially in cases of defendants with long histories of violence, judges should take into account defendants’ prior compliance with court orders when issuing their sentences.</strong></p> <p>When Youngmark was convicted and judges ordered him to jail or prison, they most often stayed the sentence (meaning he did not serve time behind bars) and placed him on probation, which he freely violated. The justice system must penalize violent defendants who ignore court orders, otherwise, probationary sentences are pointless. And, when defendants violate no contact orders with impunity, where can victims turn for safety?</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Prosecutors should develop more ways to prosecute cases when victims and witnesses are unable or unwilling to talk to police or testify in court.</strong></p> <p>Research shows that a victim's credibility and probable participation at trial influence most decisions to proceed. If a victim is too frightened to testify, cases are often dismissed. By threatening victims and witnesses not to cooperate with law enforcement and prosecutors, Youngmark was able to avoid charges in 19 of the 39 cases WATCH documented. Sadly, rather than the severity of violence leading to more sanctions, the opposite occurred.</p> <p>WATCH has published 36 chronologies in our 20-year history that document increasing levels of violence and highlight gaps within the system. Youngmark’s case reminds us of a stark reality: if we do not take the utmost care with each and every case of domestic violence, the price could be a human life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><sup>1</sup>WATCH Post, Spring 2009 at <a href="../../newsletter.html" title="http://www.watchmn.org/newsletter">http://www.watchmn.org/newsletter</a>.</p>  </div>
