  <div class="content">
    <p><strong> by Marna Anderson </strong></p> <p><em>“…the stereotype of the real rape victim involves a woman who is behaving cautiously and who stays where she is supposed to be — in a good neighborhood at a reasonable hour. The more the facts deviate from this paradigm … the more she is seen as ‘precipitating her own rape, and therefore culpable.’” </em></p> <p>WATCH monitors observe many sexual assault hearings where victims are portrayed as being partly responsible for their own victimization. The following case is one such example.</p> <p>According to a criminal complaint filed in Hennepin County in June 2010, a 40-year-old woman was waiting in the early morning hours at a bus stop for her boyfriend to pick her up. She was approached from behind by a man who said he had a gun and told her to walk towards an alley where he raped her orally and vaginally. The victim reported the crime, returned with police to the crime scene, and found the condom used by the defendant. The DNA from the condom matched another profile in the Minnesota Convicted Offender DNA Database. Three months after the assault, the suspect was arrested and charged with first degree criminal sexual conduct. He was 15 years old.</p> <p>Almost two years later, WATCH volunteers monitored the jury trial, which took place in February. In opening arguments, the prosecutor described to the jury what was in the police report: a woman was raped at gunpoint when she was attacked on the street by a stranger after leaving a friend’s home, where earlier in the evening she had consumed alcohol and used cocaine.</p> <p>The defense attorney told the jury they would see evidence of “unfamiliar lifestyles” and be exposed to circumstances very different from what they are used to in their everyday lives. He emphasized that the woman had used drugs and alcohol that evening, was out late at night alone wanting to trade sex for drugs, and accused the defendant of rape when she didn’t get what she wanted. With no evidence to back it up, he also suggested she was working as a prostitute. The defense attorney created a scenario that encouraged jurors to distance themselves from the victim by evoking the <em>I-would-never-get-myself-in-that-situation</em> response.</p> <p>The defense tactics placed blame on the victim because she was acting outside of how a “good woman” would behave. Her credibility was especially questioned because of the drug use. The incident was framed as a sex for drug trade and therefore consensual. The jury found the defendant not guilty.</p> <p>This case perpetuates two common myths. First, that women consent to sex and then report to police they have been raped. FBI statistics repeatedly show that rape is the most UNDER-reported crime. Second, that women falsely report rape, when statistics show such reports are less than 2% — the same rate as false reports of robbery and other crimes.</p> <p>This sexual assault is <em>uncommon</em> in several ways. The defendant and victim were strangers. Contrary to what most people believe, stranger rapes account for less than 30% of reported assaults. In the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults, the victim knows the assailant.</p> <p>Second, the defendant used a weapon as his primary means of force. Just 11% of rapes involve weapons, with only 3% involving guns. Because most assailants know their victims, they are able to get close to them and coerce or force them in other ways, such as with threats and physical force.</p> <p>Third, the victim of this assault reported it to the police. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that 60% of all sexual assaults are not reported.</p> <p>Fourth, this case went to trial. The vast majority of all criminal cases are resolved through a negotiated plea agreement. This is particularly true with sexual assault cases, where prosecutors may opt to spare the victim from having to testify or assess that battling the rape myths may be too risky when faced with the need to hold a violent offender accountable.</p> <p>The myths our society holds about sexual violence are deeply ingrained in our psyches and reinforced through the entertainment industry and evening news. High profile cases such as the Kobe Bryant case, and more recently, the sexual assault charges (filed and later dismissed) against Dominique Strauss-Kahn shape the public’s opinion about what constitutes rape. Media portrayals have tremendous impact on whether victims make reports to the police, how cases are investigated, whether cases are charged and go to trial, and how juries make decisions.</p> <p>WATCH monitors quickly learn that myths about sexual assault are used effectively in court as a means of defense, particularly during trials. Two other recent rape trials in Hennepin County are also disturbingly illustrative. WATCH monitors reported that one victim’s credibility was challenged because she had been drinking and dancing with the defendant earlier in the evening. She became very ill from the alcohol and fell asleep at the defendant’s apartment. When she awoke, her clothing had been removed, and he was on top of her. She told him to stop. At the trial, the defendant even said, “She told me ‘no,’ but I didn’t believe she meant it.” In spite of this, the defense questioned the victim’s credibility. For example, he observed that she had a drink called “Sex on the Beach” and asked if she liked it. When her clothing was admitted for evidence, the defense attorney pointed out that she had not worn a bra the night of the assault.</p> <p>In the other case, the victim’s credibility was challenged in large part because she stopped to purchase cigarettes before going to the police to report the assault. Even though it is common for victims to wait hours, days, weeks, or months to make a report (if they make one at all), this doesn’t jibe with the commonly held misperception of the victim who flees the scene of the crime, crying and injured, and runs straight to the local police department. In both these cases, the victims were portrayed as not behaving in a manner that victims are “supposed” to according to society’s understanding of rape. The victim in the very first case I highlighted did do exactly what she was supposed to, and yet the victim-blaming myths prevailed in the end.</p> <p>Until last year, Minnesota prosecutors were not allowed to bring in testimony from expert witnesses who could inform the jury that it is common for victims to delay reporting or to not suffer physical injuries. We hope as more juries hear expert testimony these myths will be exposed for what they are in the courtroom. Ultimately, however, we must counter rape myths more broadly in society if true change is to occur.</p> <p>According to a recent study released by the University of Minnesota Humphrey Institute and the Women’s Foundation of Minnesota, by age 23, nearly 25% of Minnesota female college students have been sexually assaulted, and by midlife, 33% of Minnesota women have experienced a crime of rape. The numbers increase in communities of color, particularly among Native American women, who experience rape or attempted rape at a much higher rate than the general population.</p> <p>April is sexual assault awareness month, and we want to use our courtroom observations to raise awareness about the types of sexual assault cases that are charged in Hennepin County and their outcomes. Few make the headlines. Rape is so common that it often isn’t considered newsworthy unless it involves a high-profile defendant. This must change — we all have a stake in ending sexual assault and rape. Awareness of the reality of rape and debunking the myths that surround it need to be our top priority. Until then, the criminal system is limited in achieving justice for victims.</p><p><em>The quotes at the beginning of this article and in the adjacent sidebar were taken from</em>: Aviva Orenstein, <em>Special Issues Raised by Rape Trial,</em> 76 Fordham Law Review 1585 (207), <a href="http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol76/iss3/11" title="http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol76/iss3/11">http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol76/iss3/11</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
