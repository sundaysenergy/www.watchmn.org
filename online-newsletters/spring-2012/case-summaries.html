    <p>This article contains a selection of sexual assault cases WATCH monitored in 2011. Special thanks to WATCH intern Alison Tweddell for hours spent reading criminal complaints and compiling data from more than 100 sexual violence cases.</p> <p><strong>JOSE NMN HERRERA and LUIS ALBERTO RUVALCABAHERRERA </strong></p> <p>Jose Herrera, 24, was charged with one count each of felony first and third degree criminal sexual conduct for raping his ex-girlfriend (Victim 1) while she was unconscious and one count of first degree assault for kicking her friend (Victim 2) in the face when she tried to stop him. Victim 2 lost several teeth and suffered a concussion as a result. Victim 1 was still unconscious when a sexual assault exam was conducted. According to the criminal complaint, she had marks on her neck and a vaginal tear. The co-defendant, Luis Alberto Ruvalcaba-Herrera, 23, was charged with felony first degree assault for pulling Victim 2 off of Herrera by putting a belt around her neck and throwing her down to the floor, allowing Herrera to kick her.</p> <p>Herrera pleaded guilty to one count of third degree criminal sexual conduct, and the remaining counts were dismissed. Judge Robert Small sentenced him to 41 months in prison with credit for 57 days, with a 10-year conditional release after confinement. He was also ordered to supply a DNA sample, register as a predatory offender, and pay restitution. Judith Hawley was the prosecutor, and Mark Devaraj was the defense attorney.</p> <p>Ruvalcaba-Herrera pleaded guilty to first degree assault. Judge Small sentenced him to 60 months in prison with credit for 145 days, a downward departure from sentencing guidelines due to the plea agreement and the defendant taking “significant responsibility by pleading guilty.” He was also ordered to supply a DNA sample and pay restitution. Judith Hawley was the prosecutor, and Daniel O’Brien was the defense attorney.</p> <p><strong>AMW</strong></p> <p>*In an effort to protect the identity of the victim, WATCH is not publishing the defendant’s full name.</p> <p>AMW, 42, was charged with three counts of felony first degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of felony third degree criminal sexual conduct for sexually abusing his daughter over the course of three years, beginning when she was 14. At the time, AMW was on probation for one of six cases of assaulting his wife (the victim’s mother). According to the criminal complaint, the victim told police her father had raped her numerous times and given her a sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>Following the first assault, the victim reported it to her mother, who in response punched her, splitting her lip. The victim continued to report the sexual abuse for three years prior to these charges, but recanted each time due to AMW’s threats to kill her and pleas from him and her mother not to talk to anyone. When interviewed by police, the victim’s brother confirmed her allegations. The victim’s mother also confirmed to police that she was aware of the assaults, that she believed her children, but that she had been afraid of the defendant for several years.</p> <p>AMW pleaded guilty to one count of third degree criminal sexual conduct, and the remaining counts were dismissed. Judge Daniel Mabley sentenced him to 101 months in prison, stayed for 10 years, a downward departure from sentencing guidelines due in part to the victim’s statement to prosecutors requesting that AMW receive treatment in lieu of extended prison time. Conditions include sex offender treatment, no contact with the victim or minor children, supply a DNA sample, do not use or possess pornography, and register as a sex offender. Deborah Russell was the prosecutor, and Sonya Verkinderen was the defense attorney.</p> <p>In the nine months following sentencing, AMW had three probation violations. At his third violation hearing in February 2012, Judge Mabley ordered him to serve his sentence of 101 months, with credit for 373 days, followed by a 10-year conditional release.</p> <p><strong>GEORGE CORNELIUS WATKINS</strong></p> <p>George Cornelius Watkins, 30, was charged with felony third degree criminal sexual conduct, felony third degree burglary, and felony domestic assault for physically and sexually assaulting his girlfriend (Case 1). According to the criminal complaint, Watkins called the victim multiple times, threatened her, and demanded she come home. When she arrived, he dragged her inside by her hair, punched her multiple times in the head, and strangled her. He forced her into the bedroom, ordered her to remove her pants, and digitally penetrated her while she pleaded for him to stop. Responding officers noted a hole in the wall where he had thrown her and blood splatter consistent with a person being hit repeatedly in the head.</p> <p>While Case 1 was pending, Watkins was charged with two counts of felony violation of a no contact order, one of which resulted from him calling the victim from jail following the assault (Case 2).</p> <p>At trial for Case 1, a jury found Watkins guilty of felony domestic assault. He was acquitted of third degree criminal sexual conduct, and the felony third degree burglary charge was dismissed. Judge Moreno sentenced him to 28 months in prison with credit for 195 days. He was ordered to supply a DNA sample, register as a predatory offender, and have no contact with the victim.</p> <p>Three months later, a jury found Watkins guilty of both counts of felony violation of a no contact order in Case 2. Judge Moreno sentenced him to 32 months in prison on one count and a year and a day on the second count, to be served consecutively. These sentences were to be served concurrent to the sentence in Case 1. For both cases, the prosecutor was Daniel Allard, and the defense attorney was James Sheehy.</p> <p><strong>JEROME DORTASS DAY </strong></p> <p>Jerome Dortass Day, 34, was charged with felony third degree criminal sexual conduct for the rape in 2002 of a 15-year-old girl he met at a bus stop. At the time of the assault, police responded to Hennepin County Medical Center, where the sexual assault exam was performed. The victim reported that Day offered her a ride home, but instead drove to an unknown house and asked her, for her safety, to come inside with him because it was a bad neighborhood. Once inside, Day forced her onto a mattress, and two other men forcibly took her clothes off. After Day raped her, three other men raped her vaginally, orally, and anally. The victim passed out, and when she regained consciousness, Day and the other suspects had left.</p> <p>In 2009, following a conviction in a DWI case, Day was required to supply a DNA sample. A year later, authorities matched his DNA with the sample taken during the medical exam of the victim eight years before.</p> <p>Day pled guilty to third degree criminal sexual conduct and was sentenced to 46 months in prison with credit for 200 days, with a five-year conditional release following confinement. This was a downward departure from sentencing guidelines; Judge Daniel Moreno said it was a negotiated settlement made because of Day’s cooperation in prosecuting the other individuals involved. At sentencing, a statement was made on behalf of the victim stating that she was deeply affected by the assault and disappointed by the sentence. Thad Tudor was the prosecutor, and Jane Imholte was the defense attorney.</p> <p><strong>ANDRE ANTHONY WESTON </strong></p> <p>Andre Anthony Weston, 24, was charged with four counts of felony first degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of felony kidnapping. According to the criminal complaint, the victim was walking down the street when she was approached by Weston. The victim became afraid and offered Weston a beer, her purse, and her cell phone. When the victim ran, Weston chased her into the front yard of a house and up the front steps before dragging her to the side of the house and raping her. The victim screamed until a neighbor intervened.</p> <p>Judge Allen Oleisky presided over the jury trial. During cross examination of the victim, the defense attorney questioned her about her use of alcohol and drugs, asked if she had invited the defendant “to party with her,” inquired how often she said no during the assault, and suggested the victim was taunting the defendant about his inability to get an erection. The jury ultimately found Weston guilty of two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct and acquitted him of the remaining two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct. The felony kidnapping was dismissed. Judge Oleisky sentenced Weston to 144 months in prison with credit for 33 days, with a 10-year conditional release after confinement.</p>  </div>
