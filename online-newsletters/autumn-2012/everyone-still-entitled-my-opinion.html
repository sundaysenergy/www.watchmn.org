  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>by Susan Lenfestey, WATCH founder</strong></p> <p>In the early years of WATCH, the WATCH Post was a one-page newsletter, with defendant’s criminal histories or “chronologies” on one side and a column on the other side by yours truly called “Everyone’s Entitled to My Opinion.”</p> <p>Many things have changed in the nearly 20 years since WATCH began monitoring the courts, including this newsletter. Happily, changes have also occurred in the justice system, many of them based on the research and recommendations of WATCH. But as we’ve seen in the repugnant comments made recently by a few candidates for high office, attitudes towards women and rape still have a long way to go.</p> <p>There are changes afoot at WATCH as well. We’re pleased to announce that as of November 1, Amy Arcand is the new executive director of WATCH.</p> <p>Amy comes to WATCH with twelve years’ experience as the executive director of neighborhood organizations on Minneapolis’ north and south sides. While in her current role as Executive Director of the Corcoran Neighborhood Organization, Amy co-created Women WISDOM, a neighborhood based outreach program to women used in prostitution, and Mujeres en Accion y Poder, a leadership program for Latina women. She recently began working with the Sexual Violence Center and their La Voz del Cambio prevention initiative.</p> <p>Amy’s impressive background includes a Masters Degree in public affairs from the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey Institute, where her research centered on gender bias in elected office. At the Humphrey she also received the Thomas Swain Fellowship for Leadership.</p> <p>WATCH is also launching two new monitoring projects – one on guns, the other on sex trafficking.</p> <p>Due in large part to the leadership of WATCH, a pilot project in the 4th judicial district is scheduled to begin in January. Its goal is to make sure that guns are not left in the hands of domestic abusers. Guns have been used in the majority of domestic violence homicides in Minnesota in the past three years (and it appears this year will be a repetition). For ten years state law has required certain domestic violence defendants to surrender their guns, but the law is not being enforced in our district. We have high hopes the pilot project will change that, and are working with many dedicated partners to help the project succeed.</p> <p>Local and national initiatives are bringing pressure on the justice system to change how cases of prostitution and sex trafficking are prosecuted. As a result, Hennepin County saw its first trial (and conviction) under the trafficking statute earlier this year and WATCH is keeping a close eye on how trafficking cases are handled in court. Investigations and prosecutions are complicated by the extreme fear and vulnerability of many victims, as well as historical attitudes blaming and criminalizing those used in prostitution. As in all our efforts, our attention will focus on ways the court ensures the rights and safety of sex trafficking victims are protected.</p> <p>Court monitoring has a ripple effect. When these “silent” crimes are handled effectively and fairly, more victims come forward to report their crimes, and the justice system sends a message about what is acceptable in our society and what is not.</p> <p>Keeping WATCH up and ticking during this transition time is Donna McNamara, who stepped up from her role as Director of Communications and Development to serve as the acting executive director of WATCH. While wearing both hats, she managed to lead WATCH with clarity and selfless energy, and inspired us all to dig deeper, reach higher – and keep a sense of humor. She was ably assisted by staff members Kate Hovde, Mandy Iverson, Jill Parrott and Dawn Dougherty Cornell who also stepped up and did twice the work they were hired to do.</p> <p>Credit is also due to board chair Thompson Aderinkomi and the search committee, all of whom worked overtime with determination and dedication. Many thanks to Larissa Griffin Sponsler, Glenda Dewberry Rooney and committee chair Mary Grace Flannery for their generosity of time and spirit.</p> <p>Many things have changed since I wrote those old newsletters, but our donors, volunteers and allies in the justice system remain the best cadre of friends any organization could hope for. Everyone is <em>still</em> entitled to my opinion, but <em>that’s</em> a fact.</p>  </div>
